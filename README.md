# Try Purescript Pux

Taking a look at purescript-pux. In addition to
trying out that package, this project has a few
extra goals:

1. no Bower (psc-package only)
2. Webpack
3. effective vendor bundle with external manifest
4. live update during dev
5. see how small the JS output can be

## Prep

1. install psc-package
2. `npm run prep`


## Workflow

- start a dev server: `npm run start`
- build for deployment: `npm run build`
    - static files put to `./build`
